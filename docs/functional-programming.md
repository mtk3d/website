## Functional paradigm

Functional programming is one of three available programming paradigms (the other two are structural and object-oriented programming).
It was created before the first computer program was written. 
It is a direct consequence of the work of Alonzo Church, who invented the lambda calculus.

The fundamental characteristic of the lambda account is immutability. No value or symbol can change.

This one feature makes the functional approach lacking assignment instructions. 
In fact, it is available, but it is nevertheless subject to very strict discipline.
